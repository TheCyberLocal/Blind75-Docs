# Blind75: Decode Ways

### [â‡¦ Back to Problem Index](../../index.md)

## Textbook Problem

A string consisting of uppercase letters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:

-   `'A'` -> `"1"`
-   `'B'` -> `"2"`
-   ...
-   `'Z'` -> `"26"`

To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, `"1012"` can be mapped into:

-   `"JAB"` with the grouping `(10 1 2)`
-   `"JL"` with the grouping `(10 12)`

The grouping `(1 01 2)` is invalid because `01` cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

-   **Input**: `s = "12"`
-   **Output**: `2`
-   **Explanation**: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

**Example 2:**

-   **Input**: `s = "01"`
-   **Output**: `0`
-   **Explanation**: "01" cannot be decoded because "01" cannot be mapped into a letter.

### Constraints

-   `1 <= len(s) <= 100`
-   `s` consists only of digits.

### Approach 1: Simple Dynamic Programming

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Description**: This approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to decode the string up to each character. The key observation is that a valid decoding can be formed by considering either the last single digit or the last two digits as a letter if they form a valid character mapping.
-   **Algorithm**:

    1. Define `n` as `len(s)`.
    2. Initialize a `dp` array of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.
    3. Set `dp[0] = 1` (empty string has one way to decode) and `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0'.
    4. For each index `i` from 2 to `n`, update `dp[i]`:
        - If `s[i - 1]` is a valid single digit, add `dp[i - 1]` to `dp[i]`.
        - If `s[i - 2:i]` is a valid two-digit number, add `dp[i - 2]` to `dp[i]`.
    5. Return `dp[n]`.

```python
def num_decodings(s: str) -> int:
    if s[0] == '0':
        return 0

    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if s[i - 1] != '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
        if 10 <= int(s[i - 2:i]) <= 26:
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]

    return dp[n]
```

### Approach 2: Optimized Dynamic Programming

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
-   **Description**: This is an optimized version of the dynamic programming approach where only two variables are used to store the last two states instead of using a full array.
-   **Algorithm**:

    1. Initialize two variables, `p1` (for `dp[i - 1]`) and `p2` (for `dp[i - 2]`), both starting as 1.
    2. Iterate through the string from the second character to the end:
        - Calculate the current state based on the last single digit and the last two digits.
        - Update `p2` and `p1` accordingly.
    3. Return `p1` after the loop.

```python
def num_decodings(s: str) -> int:
    if s[0] == '0':
        return 0

    n = len(s)
    p1 = p2 = 1

    for i in range(1, n):
        current = 0
        if s[i] != '0':
            current = p1
        if 10 <= int(s[i - 1:i + 1]) <= 26:
            current += p2
        p2 = p1
        p1 = current

    return p1
```
