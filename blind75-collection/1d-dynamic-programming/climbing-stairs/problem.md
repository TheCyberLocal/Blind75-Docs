# Blind75: Climbing Stairs

### [â‡¦ Back to Problem Index](../../index.md)

## Textbook Problem

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of steps to reach the top of a staircase. You can climb with either `1` or `2` steps at a time.

Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase.

**Example 1:**

-   **Input**: `n = 2`
-   **Output**: `2`
-   **Explanation**:
    1.  `1 + 1 = 2`
    2.  `2 = 2`

**Example 2:**

-   **Input**: `n = 3`
-   **Output**: `3`
-   **Explanation**:
    1.  `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    2.  `1 + 2 = 3`
    3.  `2 + 1 = 3`

### Constraints

-   `1 <= n <= 30`

### Approach 1: Simple Dynamic Programming

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Description**: This approach uses a dynamic programming array to store the number of ways to reach each step. Starting from the top, it calculates the number of ways to reach the top by summing the ways for both the next two steps.
-   **Algorithm**:

    1.  Initialize an array `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the number of ways to reach each step.
    2.  Set the base cases: `dp[n] = 1` and `dp[n - 1] = 1`, representing the number of ways to reach the top step and the step before it.
    3.  Iterate from step `n - 2` to `0`, updating `dp[i]` based on the sum of the ways to reach the next two steps (`dp[i + 1]` and `dp[i + 2]`).
    4.  Return `dp[0]`, which contains the number of ways to reach the first step.

```pseudo
function climbStairs(n):
    dp = array of size n + 1
    dp[n] = dp[n - 1] = 1
    for i from (n - 2) to 0:
        dp[i] = dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 2]
    return dp[0]
```

### Approach 2: Optimized Dynamic Programming

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
-   **Description**: This approach uses two variables to keep track of the number of ways to reach the current and previous steps. Starting from the top, it calculates the number of ways to reach the top by summing the ways for both the next two steps.
-   **Algorithm**:

    1.  Initialize two variables, `p1` and `p2`, to store the number of ways to reach the current step and the previous step, respectively. Both are initialized to 1.
    2.  Iterate `n - 2` times, updating the two variables at each step:
        -   Update `p1` to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
        -   Update `p2` to the previous value of `p1`.
    3.  Return `p1`, which contains the number of ways to reach the `n`-th step.

```pseudo
function climbStairs(n):
    p1 = p2 = 1
    for (n - 2) times:
        p1, p2 = p1 + p2, p1
    return p1
```
