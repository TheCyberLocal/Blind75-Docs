# Blind75: Longest Common Subsequence

### [â‡¦ Back to Problem Index](../../index.md)

## Textbook Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings if one exists, otherwise return `0`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that exists in both strings.

**Example 1:**

-   **Input**: `text1 = "cat"`, `text2 = "crabt"`
-   **Output**: `3`
-   **Explanation**: The longest common subsequence is `"cat"` which has a length of 3.

**Example 2:**

-   **Input**: `text1 = "abcd"`, `text2 = "abcd"`
-   **Output**: `4`

**Example 3:**

-   **Input**: `text1 = "abcd"`, `text2 = "efgh"`
-   **Output**: `0`

### Constraints

-   `1 <= len(text1), len(text2) <= 1000`
-   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase letters.

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
-   **Description**: This approach uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest common subsequence. We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`. If the characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]` are the same, then `dp[i][j]` will be `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. Otherwise, it will be the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.
-   **Algorithm**:

    1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` with all values set to `0`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`, respectively.
    2. Iterate through the strings `text1` and `text2` using two nested loops.
    3. For each pair of characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]`, if they are equal, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. Otherwise, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
    4. The value at `dp[m][n]` will contain the length of the longest common subsequence.

```pseudo
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m = len(text1)
    n = len(text2)
    dp = 2D array of size (m+1) x (n+1) initialized to 0

    for i from 1 to m:
        for j from 1 to n:
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

    return dp[m][n]
```
