# Blind75: Unique Paths

### [â‡¦ Back to Problem Index](../../index.md)

## Textbook Problem

There is an `m x n` grid where you are allowed to move either down or to the right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that can be taken from the top-left corner of the grid `(grid[0][0])` to the bottom-right corner of the grid `(grid[m - 1][n - 1])`.

You may assume the output will fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

- **Input**: `m = 3`, `n = 6`
- **Output**: `21`

**Example 2:**

- **Input**: `m = 3`, `n = 3`
- **Output**: `6`

### Constraints

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
